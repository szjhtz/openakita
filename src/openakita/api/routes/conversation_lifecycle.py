"""Centralized conversation lifecycle manager.

Manages busy-lock state transitions and ensures consistent cleanup across
all exit paths (normal completion, cancel, delete, disconnect).

Previously, busy-lock logic was scattered across chat.py (_mark_busy,
_clear_busy) and only released in _stream_chat's finally block, which
caused stale "in-progress" states when conversations were cancelled or
deleted through different code paths.
